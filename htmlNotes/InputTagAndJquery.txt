1.'name' attribute is used for nothing but refernce like id.However,in case of type radio,it has got another meaning in form that it indiactes the group of points.

2.To get the value of input tag,we donot use .text()(actually .text() donot work also),else we use .val().
.text() is used with all other tags like h,p,etc. to get their text value.

3.'value' and not 'val' is of not much importance when used with type='text' ot 'submit' ,but it is of utmost importnace when used with 'radio',since text which is written beside radio button is of no use.Jquery cannot get text written beside radio button.
