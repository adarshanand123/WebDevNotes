Use 
#container{
	background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
	width:60%;
	margin:15px auto;
	overflow: auto;
	padding:20px;
}


1.
instead of 
#container{
	background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
	margin:5px 10px 5px 10px;  //Giving a lot of margins instead of 'width' would cause pages behave improperly in cellphone i.e. it will not be responsive.
	overflow: auto;
	padding:20px;
}

2.Since you are making a container,it is good practice to use padding,instaed of margin from each of inner child elements.

3.It is very good practice to use overflow: auto to make page responsive and proper behaviour of page.

4.it is also a good practice to use min-height or max-height with container for proper look.
