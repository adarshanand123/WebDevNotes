There are only three types of things:-
1.text : inline or block
2.image: inline but special
because
images can shrink and expand but text cannot.

3.video


1.Width and height of element means content available to put something into(i.e blue box ).But this works for block only.
2.blue box of span is unaffected by width and height and always equal to its content.
